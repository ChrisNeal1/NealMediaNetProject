        Though only 26, Chris Neal has been conducting legal video depositions for over 7 years. What started with a love for video in a Sanger High class, followed by an internship with ValleyPBS while attending Fresno State, Chris intended on going into live broadcasting and video editing for a local TV station. Before being able to finish his degree, and while learning that what he wanted to do wasn't quite for him, he had the opportunity to start Neal Media Services, with a goal to provide video and media services to the Central Valley. Specializing in the legal aspect of video, Chris aims to push Neal Media toward commercial, corporate and wedding video. </p>
        <hr class="linebreak">
        <p class="white">On the weekends he can be found working on short films with local writers and directors throughout the Valley, and when not working on media, Chris can be found hanging out with his dog, Hennessy, and spending time with his brothers, friends and girlfriend.
